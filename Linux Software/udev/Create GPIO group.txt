Create GPIO Group Raspberry Pi 5
To create a GPIO group on a Raspberry Pi 5, you need to follow a series of steps that involve creating the group, adding users to it, and configuring the necessary permissions. Here is a step-by-step guide:

Create the "gpio" group: This group will be used to manage access to GPIO-related kernel devices such as /dev/gpiomem, /dev/gpiochip0, etc. You can create the group using the following command:

sudo groupadd gpio

Add the user to the "gpio" group: Once the group is created, you need to add the user who will be accessing the GPIO pins to this group. For example, to add a user named "newuser" to the "gpio" group, use the following command:

sudo usermod -a -G gpio newuser

Reboot the Raspberry Pi: After adding the user to the "gpio" group, reboot the Raspberry Pi to ensure that the changes take effect:

sudo reboot

Verify the group permissions: After rebooting, you should verify that the /dev/gpiomem device has the correct group permissions set to "gpio". You can check this using the following command:

ls -l /dev/gpiomem

or

ls -l /dev/gpiomem0

The udev rules file needs to be installed and Rpi rebooted for user access to the GPIO pins.
